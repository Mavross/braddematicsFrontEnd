        I love berb I want him to have my children and be with me forever. He is the worst r6 player 
        I've ever fucking seen though. Why the fuck does he keep using amaru to rush in? He just dies 
        80% of the time and its quite difficult to win a 4v5 expecially when we're in plat lobbies cause 
        of gavin. This shit is rough. Bro needs to play a normal op. I beg.
